I use [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) for note taking both personal and work notes.

Logseq defaults all pages to private, I have to specifically tag a page as public and then export the graph in order for it to appear in docs/LogSeq Public Notes.
I periodically export and sync the public notes folder, which pushes all of my public notes to https://docs.joshuarice.co.uk/
